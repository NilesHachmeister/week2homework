# week2homework



About the project: The goal of this page was to inform people about my work. In the header there is a navigation section to allow people to jump to different parts of the page. Below that there is an about me section where I write a little bit about myself. This section also contains a picture of me. Below that there are pictures that link to my work. Currently there is only one project that works and the rest are placeholders. At the bottom of the page there is a contact me section. This links to different ways that potential employers would be able to contact me. 
Part of the focus on the project was to demonstrate my mastery of HTML and CSS. This includes the way in which the page changes based on the view port. I also wanted to add effects on hover to give the page a more lively feel. While I think it demonstrates my mastery of these languages I am also aware that it demonstrates my lack of artistic ability.


Built Using: HTML CSS This page was built with accessibility as a main focus

Usage: The only thing the user will need to do is to open the webpage. The user will be able to use the nav section to navigate throughout the page. The user will also be able to click on the pictures of my work to navigate to webpages containing my work. At the bottom of the page the user is able to click on the contact me links to open up different interfaces to contact me.
