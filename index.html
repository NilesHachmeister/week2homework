                <p>I am currently in a coding bootcamp for web development. My goal is to become a web developer after
                    the
                    completion of the bootcamp.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In Spring of 2015 I graduated from Colorado State University with a Bachelors degree in Phycology
                    with a
                    focus on mind, brain, and behavior. After completion of my bachelors degree I have focused on
                    managing
                    at pizza huts in the Fort Collins area, including a two and a half year stent as the general manager
                    of
                    the Windsor Location.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The pivot from psychology to management and then to web development may seem like a strange one. In
                    reality it all comes down to one simple skill set that I thrive on, problem solving. All of my past
                    has
                    lead me to understand how to break down problems to achieve a satisfactory solution. I am thrilled
                    to be
                    able to use this skill towards web development in the future.
                </p>
